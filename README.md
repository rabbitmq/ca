## RabbitMQ Contributor Agreement

This repository contains a copy of RabbitMQ Contributor Agreement.

## How to Submit

If you are going to contribute code to RabbitMQ, it's a good idea to fill out this
document, sign in, and email a scan of the signed version to `contribute@rabbitmq.com`.
This would make it much easier
(in some cases, possible) for the RabbitMQ team at Pivotal to accept your
contribution.

Thank you for going through this pain.
